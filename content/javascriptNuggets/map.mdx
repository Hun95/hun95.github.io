```jsx
const people = [
  {
    name: "lady gaga",
    age: 32,
    job: "singer",
  },
  {
    name: "post Malon",
    age: 28,
    job: "singer",
  },

  {
    name: "John Sina",
    age: 40,
    job: "wrestler",
  },

  {
    name: "LEe",
    age: 60,
    job: "President",
  },
];
// Quokka.js - Extension
// returns a new array
// dose not change the size of original array ( unlke filter)
// uses values from original array when making new one
```
<br/>
<br/>


```jsx
    const ages = people.map(()=>());
    //
    const ages = people.map(()=>{ return });
    //

    const function;

    const ages = people.map(function);


```

## First

```jsx
const ages = people.map(() => {});
console.log(ages); // [undifined, undifined, undifined ]
```

the reason why map function return a orignal array

## Second

```javascript
const ages = people.map((person)=>(
    console.log(person)
    return 'hello world'
))
    console.log(ages);
```
