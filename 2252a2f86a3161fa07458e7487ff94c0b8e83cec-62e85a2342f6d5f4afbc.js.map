Scenes with `duration == 0`:  \r\n     *  Scenes that have no duration by definition have no ending. Thus the `end` event will never be fired.  \r\n     *  When the trigger position of the scene is passed the events are always fired in this order:  \r\n     *  `enter`, `start`, `progress` when scrolling forward  \r\n     *  and  \r\n     *  `progress`, `start`, `leave` when scrolling in reverse\r\n     *  2. Scenes with `duration > 0`:  \r\n     *  Scenes with a set duration have a defined start and end point.  \r\n     *  When scrolling past the start position of the scene it will fire these events in this order:  \r\n     *  `enter`, `start`, `progress`  \r\n     *  When continuing to scroll and passing the end point it will fire these events:  \r\n     *  `progress`, `end`, `leave`  \r\n     *  When reversing through the end point these events are fired:  \r\n     *  `enter`, `end`, `progress`  \r\n     *  And when continuing to scroll past the start position in reverse it will fire:  \r\n     *  `progress`, `start`, `leave`  \r\n     *  In between start and end the `progress` event will be called constantly, whenever the progress changes.\r\n     * \r\n     * In short:  \r\n     * `enter` events will always trigger **before** the progress update and `leave` envents will trigger **after** the progress update.  \r\n     * `start` and `end` will always trigger at their respective position.\r\n     * \r\n     * Please review the event descriptions for details on the events and the event object that is passed to the callback.\r\n     * \r\n     * @method ScrollMagic.Scene#progress\r\n     * @example\r\n     * // get the current scene progress\r\n     * var progress = scene.progress();\r\n     *\r\n     * // set new scene progress\r\n     * scene.progress(0.3);\r\n     *\r\n     * @fires {@link Scene.enter}, when used as setter\r\n     * @fires {@link Scene.start}, when used as setter\r\n     * @fires {@link Scene.progress}, when used as setter\r\n     * @fires {@link Scene.end}, when used as setter\r\n     * @fires {@link Scene.leave}, when used as setter\r\n     *\r\n     * @param {number} [progress] - The new progress value of the scene `[0-1]`.\r\n     * @returns {number} `get` -  Current scene progress.\r\n     * @returns {Scene} `set` -  Parent object for chaining.\r\n     */\n\n\n    this.progress = function (progress) {\n      if (!arguments.length) {\n        // get\n        return _progress;\n      } else {\n        // set\n        var doUpdate = false,\n            oldState = _state,\n            scrollDirection = _controller ? _controller.info(\"scrollDirection\") : 'PAUSED',\n            reverseOrForward = _options.reverse || progress >= _progress;\n\n        if (_options.duration === 0) {\n          // zero duration scenes\n          doUpdate = _progress != progress;\n          _progress = progress < 1 && reverseOrForward ? 0 : 1;\n          _state = _progress === 0 ?
